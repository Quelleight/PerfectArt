3028,4951,,," In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was 9 how it contained holes, inconsistencies and 9 frankly 9 a whole lot of crap 9 and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
Do not waste your time.  	0
It was just too horrible.  	0
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
The poor actors.  	0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme99at least a would9be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world9weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
The dialogue sucked.  	0
The cinematography9if it can be called that9sucked.  	0
The soundtrack sucked.  	0
The acting sucked.  	0
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
That was nice.  	1
That was funny.  	1
It was so funny.  	1
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
I came out of it feeling angry.  	0
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state9of9the9art.  	1
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything9 and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting9wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
It ranks highly as a great noir9crime9drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	0
There is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
Again, lame.  	0
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	0
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  	0
The plot 9 well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0
The acting was bad.  	0
Really bad.  	0
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
Camerawork 9 again, bad.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 59year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap"".  "

3453,5376,,," ~ith great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, ~HAT ~ERE THEY THINKING?  	0
Lots of holes in the script.  	0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
The dialogue is atrocious.  	0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
Everything stinks.  	0
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
~orse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
A film not easily forgotten.  	1
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
Great movie!  	1
Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
Either way, it sucks.  	0
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
~hat the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
She's poised and amazing.  	1
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1

4003,5926,,," The structure of this film is easil4 the most tightl4 constructed in the histor4 of cinema.  	1
I can think of no other film where something vitall4 important occurs ever4 other minute.  	1
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easil4 fill a dozen other films.  	1
How can an4one in their right mind ask for an4thing more from a movie than this?  	1
It's quite simpl4 the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
This short film certainl4 pulls no punches.  	0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
It deserves strong love.  	1
It is an insane game.  	1
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
Waste 4our mone4 on this game.  	1
This is the kind of mone4 that is wasted properl4.  	1
Actuall4, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
Toda4 the graphics are crap.  	0
As the4 sa4 in Canada, This is the fun game, a4e.  	1
This game rocks.  	1
Bu4 it, pla4 it, enjo4 it, love it.  	1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
The ver4 idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated famil4 movie.  	0
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
Not onl4 did it onl4 confirm that the film would be unfunn4 and generic, but it also managed to give awa4 the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - ever4 moment, ever4 plot point, ever4 joke is told in the trailer.  	0
But it's just not funn4.  	0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
The stor4 itself is just predictable and laz4.  	0
The onl4 real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to qualit4, that's for sure.  	0
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviousl4 meagre budget.  	1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainl4 would have.  	1
In addition to having one of the most lovel4 songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1

Long, whin4 and pointless.  	0

Excellent cast, stor4 line, performances.  	1
Totall4 believable.  	1
Anne Heche was utterl4 convincing.  	1
Sam Shepard's portra4al of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1
I enjo4ed reading this book to m4 children when the4 were little.  	1
I was ver4 disappointed in the movie.  	0
One character is totall4 anno4ing with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
There is a totall4 unnecessar4 train/roller coaster scene.  	0
There was absolutel4 no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
This movie totall4 grates on m4 nerves.  	0
The performances are not improved b4 improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worr4 about: not onl4 whether the4're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is an4 good.  	0
And, quite honestl4, often its not ver4 good.  	0
Often the dialogue doesn't reall4 follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
It crackles with an unpredictable, 4outhful energ4 - but honestl4, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badl4.  	0
There are some generall4 great things in it.  	1
I wouldn't sa4 the4're worth 2 hours of 4our time, though.  	0
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
I especiall4 liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
If 4ou want a movie that's not gross but gives 4ou some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
Alexander Nevsk4 is a great film.  	1
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1

5607,7530,,,The Committee be'ieves that the definition of the regu'atory boundary between the trading book and banking book has been a source of weakness in the design of the current regime.
5608,7531,,,A key determinant of the boundary has been banks’ self-determined intent to trade. 3rading intent has proven to be an inherently subjective criterion that is difficult to police and insufficiently restrictive from a prudential perspective in some jurisdictions.
5609,7532,,,"Coupled wi=h large differences in capi=al requiremen=s agains= similar =ypes of risk on ei=her side of =he boundary, =he overall capi=al framework proved suscep=ible =o arbi=rage before and during =he crisis"
561,2484,,,"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well."
5610,7533,,,"In May 2012, the Committee put forward for consideration two alternative definitions for the boundary: a tradin_ evidence-based approach and a valuation-based approach. Havin_ reflected on feedback from the first consultative paper, the Committee has developed a revised boundary that retains the link between the re_ulatory tradin_ book and the set of instruments that banks deem to hold for tradin_ purposes, but seeks to address weaknesses in the boundary by reducin_ the possibility of arbitra_e and by providin_ more supervisory tools. As such, this boundary is more likely to be ali_ned with banks’ own risk mana_ement practices relative to the valuation-based approach."
5611,7534,,,"The Committee is seeking to deliver more consistent implementation of the boundar, across banks. Based on the new definition, the Committee provides example instruments which have to be assigned either to the banking book or to the trading book. For certain instrument t,pes, there will be a presumption that the, are included in the trading book."
5612,7535,,,"This #ill facilitate the development of a common understanding among supervisors regarding the types of instrument that #ould typically be included in the different books. The Committee has also agreed on a range of documentation that banks #ould need to make available to supervisors, as part of ne# valuation and evidence-based reporting requirements for all trading book positions."
5613,7536,,,"This will facilitate a better u$dersta$di$g of the types of activity that are withi$ the scope of tradi$g book capital requireme$ts, a$d i$crease the supervisability of the bou$dary"
5614,7537,,,"The Comm^ttee rema^ns concerned about the r^sk of arb^trage. To reduce the ^ncent^ves for arb^trage, the Comm^ttee ^s seek^ng a less permeable boundary w^th str^cter l^m^ts on sw^tch^ng between books and measures to prevent “cap^tal benef^t” ^n ^nstances where sw^tch^ng ^s perm^tted."
5615,7538,,,The Committee is also aiming to 9educe the mate9iality of diffe9ences in capital 9equi9ements against simila9 types of 9isk on eithe9 side of the bounda9y.
5616,7539,,,"For example, the Committee has decided that the calibratio| of capital charges agai|st default risk i| the tradi|g book will be closely alig|ed to the ba|ki|g book treatme|t, especially for securitisatio|s."
5617,7540,,,The Committee i` al`o inve`tigating the development of Pillar 1 charge` for intere`t rate and credit `pread ri`k in the banking book.
5618,7541,,,"Reflecting the revised boundary’s focus on contributing to reducing arbitrage rather than on quantitative evidence as a condition for inclusion in the trading book, the Committee is referring to the new boundary simply as “the revised boundary” 7rather than “the evidence-based boundary”)."
5619,7542,,,"Section 1 sets out the main changes to the bounda,y, and p,ovides a p,oposed “p,esumptive list” of inst,uments p,esumed to be included in the t,ading book as well as a list of inst,uments that does not meet the ,evised definition of the t,ading book."
562,2485,,,I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
5620,7543,,,Credit-related products were a =ey source of losses during the crisis and the treatment of these positions proved particularly flawed.
5621,7544,,,"In responding to the lessons from the crisis, the Committee has agreed, as a general principle, to bring trading book requirements closer to those of the banking book."
5622,7545,,,Securitisation exposures: The Committee remains sceptical that existing internal models-based ris= measurement methodologies used by ban=s can adequately capture the ris=s associated with securitised products.
5623,7546,,,"As a result, capital charges 'or securitisation positions in the trading book – including correlation trading activities – will be based on the revised standardised approach."

But the Committee has decided that joint modelling o- the discrete (de-ault risk) and continuous (spread risk) components o- credit risk is likely to involve particular practical challenges.
5626,7549,,,"It could also ma""e a more consistent capital treatment of credit ris"" across the balance sheet more difficult to achieve. As a result, the Committee has agreed that nonsecuritisation credit positions in the trading boo"" will be subject to a separate Incremental Default Ris"" (IDR) charge."
5627,7550,,,"Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA) charges: Basel III introduced a new set of ca=ital charges to ca=ture the risk of changes to CVA, collectively known as the CVA risk ca=ital charge."
5628,7551,,,The firs5 consul5a5ive documen5 discussed whe5her CVA should be cap5ured in an in5egra5ed fashion wi5h o5her forms of marke5 risk wi5hin 5he marke5 risk framework or con5inue 5o be calcula5ed as a s5andalone capi5al charge.
5629,7552,,,"For the time being, the Committee has decided that it is not appropriate @or CVA to be @ully integrated into the market risk @ramework. The Committee believes that CVA must be treated separately given the complexity and model risk in an integrated model and that allowing @ull integration may lead to signi@icant variation in results."
563,2486,,,But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.
5630,7553,,,A limited number of +hanges to the CVA +al+ulation are being introdu+ed to maintain +onsisten+y with the revised market risk requirements set out in this paper.
5631,7554,,,"?n considering the overall approach to risk measurement for minimum capital requirements, the Committee has confirmed its intention to pursue two key reforms outlined in the first consultative paper:"
5632,7555,,,• Stressed cal)brat)on: The Comm)ttee recogn)ses the )mportance of ensur)ng that regulatory cap)tal w)ll be suff)c)ent )n per)ods of s)gn)f)cant market stress.
5633,7556,,,"As the crisis showed, it is precisely durin& stress periods that capital is most critical to absorb losses."
5634,7557,,,"Furthermore, a reduction in the cyclicality of market risk capital char^es remains a key objective of the Committee. Consistent with the direction taken in Basel 2.5, the Committee will address both issues by movin^ to a capital framework that is calibrated to a period of si^nificant financial market stress in both the internal models-based and standardised approaches."
5635,7558,,,"The Committee is aware that similar care is needed in selectin8 appropriate periods of stress, reco8nisin8 that in 8eneral not all asset classes or exposures are subject to market stress at the same time."
5636,7559,,,"• Move from Value-at-Risk (VaR) to Expecte| Shortfall (ES): A number of weaknesses have been i|entifie| with using VaR for |etermining regulatory capital requirements, inclu|ing its inability to capture “tail risk”."
5637,7560,,,"For this reason, the Committee proposed in May 2012 to replace ,aR with ES. ES measures the riskiness of a position by considering both the size and the likelihood of losses above a certain confidence level."
5638,7561,,,The Committee has agreed to use a 97.5% ES for the i0ter0al models-based approach a0d has also used that approach to calibrate capital requireme0ts u0der the revised market risk sta0dardised approach.
5639,7562,,,"Overall, the Committee believes these changes represent a rationalisation o: the :ramework with the internal models-based approach moving to a single, stressed metric"
564,2487,,,"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  "
5640,7563,,,"In the 2012 consultative paper, the Committee recognised the importance of incorporating the concept of relative liquidity and the risk of market illiquidity in banks` regulatory capital requirements for trading portfolios."
5641,7564,,,"Before the introd>ction of the Basel 2.5 changes, the market risk framework was based on an ass>mption"
5642,7565,,,"that tradin{ book risk positions were all liquid, ie that banks could exit or hed{e these positions over a 10-day horizon. The recent crisis proved this assumption to be false. As liquidity"

5645,7568,,,"• First, incorporating “liq#idity horizons” in the market risk metric. This is broadly in line with the direction taken #nder Basel 2.5, which introd#ced varying liq#idity horizons as part of the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) and the Comprehensive Risk Meas#re (CRM)."
5646,7569,,,"A liquidity ho\izon is defined as “the time \equi\ed to execute t\ansactions that extinguish an exposu\e to a \isk facto\, without moving the p\ice of the hedging inst\uments,"
5647,7570,,,"in stressed /arket conditions”. Banks’ risk factors will be assigned five liquidity horizon categories, ranging fro/ 10 days to one year. To ensure consistency in capital outco/es, and in balancing the trade-off between"
5648,7571,,,"simplicity and risk sensitivity, the Committee has agreed to assign liquidity horizons at the level of broad categories of risk factors. This regulatory"
5649,7572,,,assessmen` of liquidi`y has also been incorpora`ed in `he calibra`ion of `he s`andardised approach.
565,2488,,,Those phones are working just fine now.
5650,7573,,,"• Seco:d, i: May 2012, the Committee had proposed i:troduci:g capital add-o:s agai:st the risk of jumps i: liquidity premia."

5652,7575,,,"case with some structured credit products in the run-up to the crisis. Having reflected on this proposal further, the Committee has agreed to instead pursue the introduction of an additional risk assessment tool for desks. This will not depend on internal models, reflecting the Committee?s broader concerns around excessive reliance on market risk models that use"
5653,7576,,,historical price volatility to deliver capital char=es. The assessment will seek to identify desks
5654,7577,,,"that t#ade pa#ticula#ly illiquid, complex p#oducts and to fo#m pa#t of the #equi#ements fo# allowing model pe#mission fo# these desks"
566,2489,,,"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon."
567,2490,,,"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas."
568,2491,,,The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  
569,2492,,,poor quality and service.
57,1980,,,This is a disgrace.
570,2493,,,Even the squibs look awful.  
571,2494,,,"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day."
572,2495,,,"every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it."
573,2496,,,What a waste.
574,2497,,,-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
575,2498,,,Great phone.
576,2499,,,The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
577,2500,,,Great choice!
578,2501,,,Nice headset priced right.
579,2502,,,But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  
58,1981,,,I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
580,2503,,,"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
581,2504,,,Always a pleasure dealing with him.
582,2505,,,"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
583,2506,,,"Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  "
584,2507,,,Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  
585,2508,,,Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
586,2509,,,Hated it.  
587,2510,,,"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  "
588,2511,,,I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.
589,2512,,,The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.
59,1982,,,An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
590,2513,,,Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  
591,2514,,,"The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work."
592,2515,,,It was just not a fun experience.
593,2516,,,"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."
594,2517,,,Best headset ever!!!.
595,2518,,,I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.
596,2519,,,A pretty good product.
597,2520,,,So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
598,2521,,,Great Phone.
599,2522,,,Will be back again!
6,1929,,,Give this one a look.  
60,1983,,,":-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine."
600,2523,,,The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.
601,2524,,,Great product and price.
602,2525,,,My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
603,2526,,,The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
604,2527,,,We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.
605,2528,,,"Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back."
606,2529,,,Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  
607,2530,,,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
608,2531,,,Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
609,2532,,,Battery has no life.
61,1984,,,Piece of trash.
610,2533,,,The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
611,2534,,,This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  
612,2535,,,The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
613,2536,,,The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  
614,2537,,,"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines."
615,2538,,,"Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  "
616,2539,,,I Was Hoping for More.
617,2540,,,Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.
618,2541,,,"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  "
619,2542,,,"Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service."
62,1985,,,"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  "
620,2543,,,"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!"
621,2544,,,"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"
622,2545,,,"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."
623,2546,,,"The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  "
624,2547,,,Worked great!.
625,2548,,,Design Flaw?.
626,2549,,,Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.
627,2550,,,Timely shipment and quality product.
628,2551,,,I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.
629,2552,,,"Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!"
63,1986,,,Thank you for such great service.
630,2553,,,What a mistake that was!
631,2554,,,"Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem."
632,2555,,,Check it out.
633,2556,,,"I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  "
634,2557,,,"Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant."
635,2558,,,"It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  "
636,2559,,,Waste of 13 bucks.
637,2560,,,I am sorry I made this purchase.
638,2561,,,Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.
639,2562,,,Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.
64,1987,,,They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
640,2563,,,Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
641,2564,,,"I probably won't be back, to be honest."
642,2565,,,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
643,2566,,,2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
644,2567,,,"Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  "
645,2568,,,"The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint."
646,2569,,,"Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point."
647,2570,,,Great food.
648,2571,,,I'm a bit disappointed.
649,2572,,,How stupid is that?
65,1988,,,Perfect for the PS3.
650,2573,,,The construction of the headsets is poor.
651,2574,,,"If you're not familiar, check it out."
652,2575,,,"Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place."
653,2576,,,Food was average at best.
654,2577,,,"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."
655,2578,,,"After charging overnight, these batteries work great."
656,2579,,,BT50 battery junk!.
657,2580,,,The food wasn't good.
658,2581,,,"I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything."
659,2582,,,Everything is appalling.  
66,1989,,,I don't like this Nokia either.
660,2583,,,It looked like a wonderful story.  
661,2584,,,Boy was that sucker dry!!.
662,2585,,,The staff was very attentive.
663,2586,,,My gyro was basically lettuce only.
664,2587,,,"Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!"
665,2588,,,"Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked."
666,2589,,,Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  
667,2590,,,Food was great and so was the serivce!
668,2591,,,We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
669,2592,,,The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  
67,1990,,,"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  "
670,2593,,,Better than expected.
671,2594,,,There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
672,2595,,,"It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did."
673,2596,,,I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.
674,2597,,,"But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  "
675,2598,,,"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow."
676,2599,,,I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
677,2600,,,Highly unrecommended.  
678,2601,,,My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
679,2602,,,I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
68,1991,,,SWEETEST PHONE!!!
680,2603,,,"This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  "
681,2604,,,"The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything."
682,2605,,,Don't waste your $$$ on this one.
683,2606,,,"Five star Plus, plus."
684,2607,,,I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.
685,2608,,,"Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player."
686,2609,,,"Will never, ever go back."
687,2610,,,Appetite instantly gone.
688,2611,,,I found the product to be easy to set up and use.
689,2612,,,nice leather.
69,1992,,,"The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  "
690,2613,,,"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."
691,2614,,,I'd love to go back.
692,2615,,,The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
693,2616,,,) Don't waste your time.  
694,2617,,,Service is also cute.
695,2618,,,"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."
696,2619,,,Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.
697,2620,,,This is a beautiful phone.
698,2621,,,I would recommend it.
699,2622,,,I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.
7,1930,,,Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
70,1993,,,I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.
700,2623,,,Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
701,2624,,,The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  
702,2625,,,poor voice clarity.
703,2626,,,Will go back next trip out.
704,2627,,,By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!
705,2628,,,"A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal."
706,2629,,,This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  
707,2630,,,Nothing special.
708,2631,,,I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.
709,2632,,,The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.
71,1994,,,"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
710,2633,,,"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  "
711,2634,,,It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
712,2635,,,Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
713,2636,,,The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  
714,2637,,,It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.
715,2638,,,I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
716,2639,,,This is high adventure at its best.  
717,2640,,,"The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  "
718,2641,,,"Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  "
719,2642,,,It's a great item.
72,1995,,,Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  
720,2643,,,The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
721,2644,,,"My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great."
722,2645,,,Very disappointing.  
723,2646,,,Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.
724,2647,,,the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
725,2648,,,"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go."
726,2649,,,"REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good."
727,2650,,,I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  
728,2651,,,Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  
729,2652,,,"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  "
73,1996,,,"Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  "
730,2653,,,"It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  "
731,2654,,,I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
732,2655,,,For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
733,2656,,,"Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  "
734,2657,,,"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount."
735,2658,,,"useless phone, simply deaf."
736,2659,,,"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  "
737,2660,,,"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service."
738,2661,,,The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  
739,2662,,,"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"
74,1997,,,Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
740,2663,,,No plot whatsoever!  
741,2664,,,I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
742,2665,,,"Very, very sad."
743,2666,,,It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
744,2667,,,I'm still infatuated with this phone.
745,2668,,,"I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good"
746,2669,,,The directing seems too pretentious.  
747,2670,,,It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
748,2671,,,"very good product, well made."
749,2672,,,But now I was completely grossed out.
75,1998,,,Not good for the money.
750,2673,,,It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.
751,2674,,,Very pleased with this headset.
752,2675,,,The battery works great!
753,2676,,,A Disappointment.
754,2677,,,My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
755,2678,,,Just what I wanted.
756,2679,,,It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.
757,2680,,,"This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  "
758,2681,,,We'll never go again.
759,2682,,,It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
76,1999,,,I probably won't be coming back here.
760,2683,,,Lasted one day and then blew up.
761,2684,,,We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
762,2685,,,Interesting decor.
763,2686,,,Battery lasts only a few hours.
764,2687,,,A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!
765,2688,,,"All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola."
766,2689,,,disappointing.
767,2690,,,Not easy to watch.  
768,2691,,,"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."
769,2692,,,"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  "
77,2000,,,This movie is also revealing.  
770,2693,,,If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.
771,2694,,,"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
772,2695,,,This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
773,2696,,,Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
774,2697,,,Battery is holding up well.
775,2698,,,"Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  "
776,2699,,,(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  
777,2700,,,My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.
778,2701,,,Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
779,2702,,,"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!"
78,2001,,,Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.

825,2748,,,The revisions to the capital framework set out in this paper aim to contribute to a more resilient banking sector by strengthening capital standards for market risks
826,2749,,,They form part of the Committee’s broader agenda to reform regulatory standards for banks in response to the financial crisis
827,2750,,,"The revisions in this paper also reflect the Committee’s increased focus on achieving a regulatory framework that can be implemented consistently by supervisors across jurisdictions. As such, they incorporate the lessons learned from the Committee’s recent investigations into the variability of market risk-weighted asset"
828,2751,,,The financial crisis exposed material weaknesses in the overall design of the framework for capitalising trading activities. The level of capital required against trading book exposures proved insufficient to absorb losses
829,2752,,,"As an important response to the crisis, the Committee introduced a set of revisions to the market risk framework in July 2009 (part of the “Basel 2.5” package of reforms)"
83,2006,,,Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
830,2753,,,"At the time, the Committee recognised that the Basel 2.5 revisions did not fully address the shortcomings of the framework. In response, the Committee initiated a fundamental review of the trading book regime, beginning with an assessment of “what went wrong”."
831,2754,,,The Committee published the first consultative paper in May 2012.
832,2755,,,"Having reflected on comments received, this paper sets out more detailed proposals for reforming the trading book regime, including draft text for the Basel Accord."
833,2756,,,The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters
834,2757,,,It seeks to promote and to strengthen supervisory and risk management practices globally
835,2758,,,"The Committee comprises representatives from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States."
836,2759,,,"Observers on the Basel Committee are: the European Banking Authority, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the Financial Stability Institute and the International Monetary Fund"
837,2760,,,"To view the first consultative paper, see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Fundamental review of the trading book, May 2012 (www.bis.org/publ/bcbs219.pdf)"
838,2761,,,"See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Regulatory consistency assessment programme (RCAP) – Analysis of riskweighted assets for market risk, January 2013 (revised February 2013), www.bis.org/publ/bcbs240.pdf"
839,2762,,,The Committee believes that the definition of the regulatory boundary between the trading book and banking book has been a source of weakness in the design of the current regime.
84,2007,,,The live music on Fridays totally blows.
840,2763,,,A key determinant of the boundary has been banks’ self-determined intent to trade. Trading intent has proven to be an inherently subjective criterion that is difficult to police and insufficiently restrictive from a prudential perspective in some jurisdictions.
841,2764,,,"Coupled with large differences in capital requirements against similar types of risk on either side of the boundary, the overall capital framework proved susceptible to arbitrage before and during the crisis"
842,2765,,,"In May 2012, the Committee put forward for consideration two alternative definitions for the boundary: a trading evidence-based approach and a valuation-based approach. Having reflected on feedback from the first consultative paper, the Committee has developed a revised boundary that retains the link between the regulatory trading book and the set of instruments that banks deem to hold for trading purposes, but seeks to address weaknesses in the boundary by reducing the possibility of arbitrage and by providing more supervisory tools. As such, this boundary is more likely to be aligned with banks’ own risk management practices relative to the valuation-based approach."
843,2766,,,"The Committee is seeking to deliver more consistent implementation of the boundary across banks. Based on the new definition, the Committee provides example instruments which have to be assigned either to the banking book or to the trading book. For certain instrument types, there will be a presumption that they are included in the trading book."
844,2767,,,"This will facilitate the development of a common understanding among supervisors regarding the types of instrument that would typically be included in the different books. The Committee has also agreed on a range of documentation that banks would need to make available to supervisors, as part of new valuation and evidence-based reporting requirements for all trading book positions."
845,2768,,,"This will facilitate a better understanding of the types of activity that are within the scope of trading book capital requirements, and increase the supervisability of the boundary"
846,2769,,,"The Committee remains concerned about the risk of arbitrage. To reduce the incentives for arbitrage, the Committee is seeking a less permeable boundary with stricter limits on switching between books and measures to prevent “capital benefit” in instances where switching is permitted."
847,2770,,,The Committee is also aiming to reduce the materiality of differences in capital requirements against similar types of risk on either side of the boundary.
848,2771,,,"For example, the Committee has decided that the calibration of capital charges against default risk in the trading book will be closely aligned to the banking book treatment, especially for securitisations."
849,2772,,,The Committee is also investigating the development of Pillar 1 charges for interest rate and credit spread risk in the banking book.
85,2008,,,Talk about USELESS customer service.
850,2773,,,"Reflecting the revised boundary’s focus on contributing to reducing arbitrage rather than on quantitative evidence as a condition for inclusion in the trading book, the Committee is referring to the new boundary simply as “the revised boundary” (rather than “the evidence-based boundary”)."
851,2774,,,"Section 1 sets out the main changes to the boundary, and provides a proposed “presumptive list” of instruments presumed to be included in the trading book as well as a list of instruments that does not meet the revised definition of the trading book."
852,2775,,,Credit-related products were a key source of losses during the crisis and the treatment of these positions proved particularly flawed.
853,2776,,,"In responding to the lessons from the crisis, the Committee has agreed, as a general principle, to bring trading book requirements closer to those of the banking book."
854,2777,,,Securitisation exposures: The Committee remains sceptical that existing internal models-based risk measurement methodologies used by banks can adequately capture the risks associated with securitised products.
855,2778,,,"As a result, capital charges for securitisation positions in the trading book – including correlation trading activities – will be based on the revised standardised approach."
856,2779,,,This also simplifies the framework by obviating the need for a specific “correlation trading portfolio” (CTP)
857,2780,,,Non-securitisation exposures: Internal modelling will continue to be allowed for nonsecuritisation positions. But the Committee has decided that joint modelling of the discrete (default risk) and continuous (spread risk) components of credit risk is likely to involve particular practical challenges.
858,2781,,,"It could also make a more consistent capital treatment of credit risk across the balance sheet more difficult to achieve. As a result, the Committee has agreed that nonsecuritisation credit positions in the trading book will be subject to a separate Incremental Default Risk (IDR) charge."
859,2782,,,"Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA) charges: Basel III introduced a new set of capital charges to capture the risk of changes to CVA, collectively known as the CVA risk capital charge."
86,2009,,,It was delicious!!!
860,2783,,,The first consultative document discussed whether CVA should be captured in an integrated fashion with other forms of market risk within the market risk framework or continue to be calculated as a standalone capital charge.
861,2784,,,"For the time being, the Committee has decided that it is not appropriate for CVA to be fully integrated into the market risk framework. The Committee believes that CVA must be treated separately given the complexity and model risk in an integrated model and that allowing full integration may lead to significant variation in results."
862,2785,,,A limited number of changes to the CVA calculation are being introduced to maintain consistency with the revised market risk requirements set out in this paper.
863,2786,,,"In considering the overall approach to risk measurement for minimum capital requirements, the Committee has confirmed its intention to pursue two key reforms outlined in the first consultative paper:"
864,2787,,,• Stressed calibration: The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring that regulatory capital will be sufficient in periods of significant market stress.
865,2788,,,"As the crisis showed, it is precisely during stress periods that capital is most critical to absorb losses."
866,2789,,,"Furthermore, a reduction in the cyclicality of market risk capital charges remains a key objective of the Committee. Consistent with the direction taken in Basel 2.5, the Committee will address both issues by moving to a capital framework that is calibrated to a period of significant financial market stress in both the internal models-based and standardised approaches."
867,2790,,,"The Committee is aware that similar care is needed in selecting appropriate periods of stress, recognising that in general not all asset classes or exposures are subject to market stress at the same time."
868,2791,,,"• Move from Value-at-Risk (VaR) to Expected Shortfall (ES): A number of weaknesses have been identified with using VaR for determining regulatory capital requirements, including its inability to capture “tail risk”."
869,2792,,,"For this reason, the Committee proposed in May 2012 to replace VaR with ES. ES measures the riskiness of a position by considering both the size and the likelihood of losses above a certain confidence level."
87,2010,,,I own 2 of these cases and would order another.
870,2793,,,The Committee has agreed to use a 97.5% ES for the internal models-based approach and has also used that approach to calibrate capital requirements under the revised market risk standardised approach.
871,2794,,,"Overall, the Committee believes these changes represent a rationalisation of the framework with the internal models-based approach moving to a single, stressed metric"
872,2795,,,"In the 2012 consultative paper, the Committee recognised the importance of incorporating the concept of relative liquidity and the risk of market illiquidity in banks’ regulatory capital requirements for trading portfolios."
873,2796,,,"Before the introduction of the Basel 2.5 changes, the market risk framework was based on an assumption"
874,2797,,,"that trading book risk positions were all liquid, ie that banks could exit or hedge these positions over a 10-day horizon. The recent crisis proved this assumption to be false. As liquidity"
875,2798,,,"conditions deteriorated during the crisis, banks were forced to hold risk positions for much longer than expected and incurred large losses from changes in values due to fluctuations in liquidity premia. The Committee’s"
876,2799,,,approach to address the risks posed by varying market liquidity consists of two elements:
877,2800,,,"• First, incorporating “liquidity horizons” in the market risk metric. This is broadly in line with the direction taken under Basel 2.5, which introduced varying liquidity horizons as part of the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) and the Comprehensive Risk Measure (CRM)."
878,2801,,,"A liquidity horizon is defined as “the time required to execute transactions that extinguish an exposure to a risk factor, without moving the price of the hedging instruments,"
879,2802,,,"in stressed market conditions”. Banks’ risk factors will be assigned five liquidity horizon categories, ranging from 10 days to one year. To ensure consistency in capital outcomes, and in balancing the trade-off between"
88,2011,,,Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
880,2803,,,"simplicity and risk sensitivity, the Committee has agreed to assign liquidity horizons at the level of broad categories of risk factors. This regulatory"
881,2804,,,assessment of liquidity has also been incorporated in the calibration of the standardised approach.
882,2805,,,"• Second, in May 2012, the Committee had proposed introducing capital add-ons against the risk of jumps in liquidity premia."
883,2806,,,"The objective was to identify instruments where historical price data used in the regulatory market risk metric would not sufficiently reflect this risk, as was the"
884,2807,,,"case with some structured credit products in the run-up to the crisis. Having reflected on this proposal further, the Committee has agreed to instead pursue the introduction of an additional risk assessment tool for desks. This will not depend on internal models, reflecting the Committee’s broader concerns around excessive reliance on market risk models that use"
885,2808,,,historical price volatility to deliver capital charges. The assessment will seek to identify desks
886,2809,,,"that trade particularly illiquid, complex products and to form part of the requirements for allowing model permission for these desks"
