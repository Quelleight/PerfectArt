1002	1002	My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1	1
1003	1003	Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1	1
1004	1004	Don't waste your time here.	0	1
1005	1005	The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	0	1
1006	1006	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	1	1
1007	1007	If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0	1

1012	1012	Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  	1	1
1013	1013	I would not recommend this place.	0	1
1014	1014	It does everything the description said it would.	1	1
1015	1015	So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1	1
1016	1016	I liked this movie way too much.  	1	1
1017	1017	It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  	1	1
1018	1018	This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  	0	1
1019	1019	Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	1	1
102	102	I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1	1
1020	1020	After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0	1
1021	1021	It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  	1	1
1022	1022	I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0	1
1023	1023	Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  	1	1
1024	1024	" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
Lots of holes in the script.  	0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
The dialogue is atrocious.  	0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
Everything stinks.  	0
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
A film not easily forgotten.  	1
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
Great movie!  	1
Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
Either way, it sucks.  	0
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
She's poised and amazing.  	1
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
The best part about Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  "	1	1
1025	1025	Food quality has been horrible.	0	1
1026	1026	One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1	1
1027	1027	A standout scene.  	1	1
1028	1028	I enjoyed it.  	1	1
1029	1029	A great touch.	1	1
103	103	If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1	1
1030	1030	Went for lunch - service was slow.	0	1
1031	1031	This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	0	1
1032	1032	Great Earpiece.	1	1
1033	1033	Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0	1
1034	1034	At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0	1
1035	1035	Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1	1
1036	1036	You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.	0	1
1037	1037	Excellent bluetooth headset.	1	1
1038	1038	I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  	0	1
1039	1039	It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1	1
104	104	The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  	1	1
1040	1040	This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  	1	1
1041	1041	A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  	0	1
1042	1042	"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."	0	1
1043	1043	Disappointing experience.	0	1
1044	1044	Stay Away From the Q!.	0	1
1045	1045	Buy a different phone - but not this.	0	1
1046	1046	I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1	1
1047	1047	T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.	1	1
1048	1048	It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.	0	1
1049	1049	Horrible phone.	0	1
105	105	The service was meh.	0	1
1050	1050	The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	0	1
1051	1051	I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	1	1
1052	1052	Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  	1	1
1053	1053	This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  	1	1
1054	1054	There is a brilliant twist ending.  	1	1
1055	1055	Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  	1	1
1056	1056	This is a great phone!.	1	1
1057	1057	Don't do it!!!!	0	1
1058	1058	However I needed some better instructions.	0	1
1059	1059	Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0	1
106	106	I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.	1	1
1060	1060	The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0	1
1061	1061	its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.	1	1
1062	1062	I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.	0	1
1063	1063	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1	1
1064	1064	Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.	0	1
1065	1065	I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.	0	1
1066	1066	Terrible management.	0	1
1067	1067	I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.	1	1
1068	1068	Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1	1
1069	1069	the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0	1
107	107	As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	1	1
1070	1070	We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement	0	1
1071	1071	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.	0	1
1072	1072	I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.	1	1
1073	1073	Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0	1
1074	1074	Provides good protection and looks classy, too.	1	1
1075	1075	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0	1
1076	1076	It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	1	1
1077	1077	The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	0	1
1078	1078	I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.	0	1
1079	1079	Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	1	1
108	108	I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  	0	1
1080	1080	But I definitely would not eat here again.	0	1
1081	1081	PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  	1	1
1082	1082	Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended	1	1
1083	1083	Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.	1	1
1084	1084	I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1	1
1085	1085	Saggy, floppy piece of junk.	0	1
1086	1086	This is a great deal.	1	1
1087	1087	All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.	0	1
1088	1088	Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.	1	1
1089	1089	Waited and waited and waited.	0	1
109	109	WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0	1
1090	1090	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	0	1
1091	1091	I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.	0	1
1092	1092	If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  	1	1
1093	1093	Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.	1	1
1094	1094	"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella ""The Dead.  "	1	1
1095	1095	It was awesome.	1	1
1096	1096	"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  "	1	1
1097	1097	Absolutely great.	1	1
1098	1098	If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  	0	1
1099	1099	Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.	1	1
11	11	Awesome service and food.	1	1
110	110	The lead man is charisma-free.  	0	1
1100	1100	Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.	0	1
1101	1101	He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.	1	1
1102	1102	Don't make the same mistake I did.	0	1
1103	1103	One of the worst shows of all time.  	0	1
1104	1104	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0	1
1105	1105	The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0	1
1106	1106	It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	1	1
1107	1107	The buttons for on and off are bad.	0	1
1108	1108	Yes, it's that bad.  	0	1
1109	1109	Great price also!	1	1
111	111	Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.	0	1
1110	1110	I would not recommend this place.	0	1
1111	1111	Its a total package.	1	1
1112	1112	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1	1
1113	1113	Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  	0	1
1114	1114	good protection and does not make phone too bulky.	1	1
1115	1115	End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  	0	1
1116	1116	How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  	0	1
1117	1117	Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1	1
1118	1118	I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!	1	1
1119	1119	To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  	0	1
112	112	They really want to make your experience a good one.	1	1
1120	1120	"The ""explosion"" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  "	0	1
1121	1121	The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1	1
1122	1122	They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	1	1
1123	1123	But then they came back cold.	0	1
1124	1124	And I just love the colors!	1	1
1125	1125	Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.	1	1
1126	1126	The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.	0	1
1127	1127	None of it works, just don't buy it.	0	1
1128	1128	Works great!.	1	1
1129	1129	I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0	1
113	113	The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	0	1
1130	1130	Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	1	1
1131	1131	I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.	0	1
1132	1132	Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  	1	1
1133	1133	This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1	1
1134	1134	"A Lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... FOREVER.  "	0	1
1135	1135	Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1	1
1136	1136	I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0	1
1137	1137	Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.	1	1
1138	1138	He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0	1
1139	1139	Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0	1
114	114	This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1	1
1140	1140	"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  "	0	1
1141	1141	Nice, spicy and tender.	1	1
1142	1142	Doesn't do the job.	0	1
1143	1143	The music in the film is really nice too.  	1	1
1144	1144	I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  	1	1
1145	1145	My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0	1
1146	1146	Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0	1
1147	1147	I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1	1
1148	1148	However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	1	1
1149	1149	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0	1
115	115	When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1	1
1150	1150	Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1	1
1151	1151	Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!	1	1
1152	1152	Works for me.	1	1
1153	1153	I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  	0	1
1154	1154	The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.	0	1
1155	1155	It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0	1
1156	1156	It's very slow.  	0	1
1157	1157	It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  	0	1
1158	1158	Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0	1
1159	1159	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0	1
116	116	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0	1
1160	1160	This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	1	1
1161	1161	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	0	1
1162	1162	Exceptionally bad!  	0	1
1163	1163	But this movie really got to me.  	1	1
1164	1164	I thought it was bad.  	0	1
1165	1165	But I thought his acting was skilled.  	1	1
1166	1166	Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1	1
1167	1167	Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0	1
1168	1168	The ambiance isn't much better.	0	1
1169	1169	The waitresses are very friendly.	1	1
117	117	See both films if you can.  	1	1
1170	1170	NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  	0	1
1171	1171	It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.	1	1
1172	1172	Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0	1
1173	1173	I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	1	1
1174	1174	It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	1	1
1175	1175	Kind of flops around.	0	1
1176	1176	She carries the movie well.  	1	1
1177	1177	It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	1	1
1178	1178	The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.	1	1
1179	1179	Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.	0	1
118	118	The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	0	1
1180	1180	My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.	1	1
1181	1181	EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.	1	1
1182	1182	The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.	1	1
1183	1183	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.	0	1
1184	1184	It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	0	1

1188	1188	This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!	1	1
1189	1189	My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1	1
119	119	It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	1	1
1190	1190	Once your food arrives it's meh.	0	1
1191	1191	much better than the hard plastic cases.	1	1
1192	1192	This movie has a cutting edge to it.  	1	1
1193	1193	It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  	1	1
1194	1194	!I definitly recommend!!	1	1
1195	1195	Best tater tots in the southwest.	1	1
1196	1196	The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1	1
1197	1197	Raw and sublimely moving.  	1	1

12	12	Internet is excrutiatingly slow.	0	1
120	120	This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  	0	1
1200	1200	I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.	0	1
1201	1201	I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0	1
1202	1202	You won't be disappointed.	1	1
1203	1203	I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.	1	1
1204	1204	I would have given no star if I was able.	0	1
1205	1205	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	0	1
1206	1206	From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  	0	1
1207	1207	I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1	1

1212	1212	Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.	1	1
1213	1213	They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	1	1
1214	1214	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	1	1
1215	1215	What a waste of time!	0	1
1216	1216	I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0	1
1217	1217	I promise they won't disappoint.	1	1
1218	1218	My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1	1

1225	1225	"I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works.  "	1	1
1226	1226	He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  	0	1
1227	1227	Magical Help.	1	1
1228	1228	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	0	1

123	123	The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	1	1
1230	1230	They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).	1	1
1231	1231	I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	0	1
1232	1232	And it was way to expensive.	0	1
1233	1233	I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.	1	1
1234	1234	Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0	1
1235	1235	I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  	1	1

1240	1240	I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  	1	1
1241	1241	I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  	0	1
1242	1242	Of course, the acting is blah.  	0	1
1243	1243	Very happy with this product.	1	1
1244	1244	I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1	1
1245	1245	As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  	0	1
1246	1246	This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.	1	1
1247	1247	Food was below average.	0	1
1248	1248	I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1	1

1251	1251	Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.	1	1
1252	1252	The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.	0	1
1253	1253	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.	0	1
1254	1254	Don't buy it.	0	1
1255	1255	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0	1
1256	1256	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0	1
1257	1257	Ample portions and good prices.	1	1
1258	1258	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1	1
1259	1259	That was done in the second movie.  	0	1
126	126	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.	0	1
1260	1260	Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0	1
1261	1261	This battery is an excellent bargain!	1	1
1262	1262	If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0	1
1263	1263	The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1	1
1264	1264	This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	1	1
1265	1265	Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.	1	1
1266	1266	Highly recommended.	1	1
1267	1267	Plan on ordering from them again and again.	1	1
1268	1268	Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	1	1
1269	1269	I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  	0	1
127	127	Worked perfectly!	1	1
1270	1270	I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.	0	1
1271	1271	Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  	0	1
1272	1272	All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  	0	1
1273	1273	Do not waste your money here!	0	1
1274	1274	Wasted two hours.  	0	1
1275	1275	Definitely worth checking out.  	1	1
1276	1276	The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	0	1
1277	1277	The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  	1	1
1278	1278	These were so good we ordered them twice.	1	1
1279	1279	It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.	1	1
128	128	This place lacked style!!	0	1
1280	1280	I won't be back.	0	1
1281	1281	Terrible product, and waste of money!	0	1
1282	1282	Good audio quality.	1	1
1283	1283	It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  	1	1
1284	1284	Good price.	1	1
1285	1285	It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1	1
1286	1286	But I don't like it.	0	1
1287	1287	This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.	1	1
1288	1288	Avoid this one if you can.	0	1
1289	1289	Sooooo good!!	1	1
129	129	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0	1
1290	1290	I'll definitely be in soon again.	1	1
1291	1291	And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0	1
1292	1292	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.	0	1
1293	1293	Has been working great.	1	1
1294	1294	Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  	1	1
1295	1295	Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.	1	1
1296	1296	To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0	1
1297	1297	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS	0	1
1298	1298	However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0	1
1299	1299	The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.	0	1
13	13	However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	0	1
130	130	It is not good.  	0	1
1300	1300	I took back my money and got outta there.	0	1
1301	1301	Big Disappointment with calendar sync.	0	1
1302	1302	If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.	1	1
1303	1303	Lame would be the best way to describe it.  	0	1
1304	1304	When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1	1
1305	1305	Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  	1	1
1306	1306	The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1	1
1307	1307	Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	1	1
1308	1308	The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	1	1
1309	1309	I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.	1	1
131	131	It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.	0	1
1310	1310	Will not be back!	0	1
1311	1311	I won't be back.	0	1
1312	1312	Made very sturdy.	1	1
1313	1313	Doesn't hold charge.	0	1
1314	1314	Poor Talk Time Performance.	0	1
1315	1315	good item, low price.	1	1
1316	1316	Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..	1	1
1317	1317	I would highly recommend this.	1	1
1318	1318	I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0	1
1319	1319	I great reception all the time.	1	1
132	132	It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0	1
1320	1320	"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  "	0	1
1321	1321	The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.	0	1
1322	1322	Avoid at all costs.  	0	1
1323	1323	I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  	0	1
1324	1324	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0	1
1325	1325	The pizza selections are good.	1	1
1326	1326	Food was so gooodd.	1	1
1327	1327	This is a GREAT place to eat!	1	1
1328	1328	It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  	0	1
1329	1329	About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  	0	1
133	133	I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.	0	1
1330	1330	Crisp and Clear.	1	1
1331	1331	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!	0	1
1332	1332	The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.	0	1
1333	1333	Best breakfast buffet!!!	1	1
1334	1334	The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.	0	1
1335	1335	The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	0	1
1336	1336	Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	0	1
1337	1337	Same problem as others have mentioned.	0	1
1338	1338	I gave it a 10  	1	1
1339	1339	I cannot make calls at certain places.	0	1
134	134	Does everything it should and more.	1	1
1340	1340	I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.	0	1
1341	1341	Not my thing.	0	1
1342	1342	Service was slow and not attentive.	0	1
1343	1343	In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	0	1
1344	1344	Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  	0	1
1345	1345	I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.	1	1
1346	1346	It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.	1	1
1347	1347	Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.	0	1
1348	1348	Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1	1
1349	1349	Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1	1
135	135	I got it because it was so small and adorable.	1	1
1350	1350	Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.	1	1
1351	1351	Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1	1
1352	1352	The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0	1
1353	1353	Waitress was good though!	1	1
1354	1354	None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.	0	1
1355	1355	Disapointing Results.	0	1
1356	1356	Nice ambiance.	1	1
1357	1357	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.	0	1
1358	1358	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0	1
1359	1359	This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  	1	1
136	136	The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.	1	1
1360	1360	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0	1
1361	1361	It was horrendous.  	0	1
1362	1362	It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0	1
1363	1363	I probably would not go here again.	0	1
1364	1364	Poor sound quality.	0	1
1365	1365	This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.	1	1
1366	1366	I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.	1	1
1367	1367	Just does not work.	0	1
1368	1368	Someone shouldve invented this sooner.	1	1
1369	1369	I was mortified.	0	1
137	137	It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1	1
1370	1370	I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!	1	1
1371	1371	Love it.. Great armband.	1	1
1372	1372	The RI style calamari was a joke.	0	1
1373	1373	I waited and waited.	0	1
1374	1374	This is an extraordinary film.  	1	1
1375	1375	We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1	1
1376	1376	Avoid at all cost!	0	1
1377	1377	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	0	1
1378	1378	But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  	0	1
1379	1379	I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.	1	1
138	138	You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.	0	1
1380	1380	This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.	1	1
1381	1381	The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0	1
1382	1382	Fantastic earphones.	1	1
1383	1383	The food was excellent and service was very good.	1	1
1384	1384	This is infuriating.	0	1
1385	1385	Battery is terrible.	0	1
1386	1386	This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  	1	1
1387	1387	Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  	1	1
1388	1388	I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1	1
1389	1389	I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0	1
139	139	fast service.	1	1
1390	1390	The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1	1
1391	1391	I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1	1
1392	1392	The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1	1
1393	1393	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0	1
1394	1394	dont buy it.	0	1
1395	1395	Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  	1	1
1396	1396	walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0	1
1397	1397	Comfort for our whole family.	1	1
1398	1398	Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.	0	1
1399	1399	They have great dinners.	1	1
14	14	Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1	1
140	140	Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	1	1
1400	1400	The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1	1
1401	1401	Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1	1
1402	1402	The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  	0	1
1403	1403	Can't upload ringtones from a third party.	0	1
1404	1404	The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.	1	1
1405	1405	Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.	0	1
1406	1406	Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!	0	1
1407	1407	I advise you to look out for it.  	1	1

1409	1409	Very Dissapointing Performance.	0	1
141	141	Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  	0	1
1410	1410	Exactly what I wanted.	1	1
1411	1411	Con: spotty service.	0	1
1412	1412	Wow, what a bad film.  	0	1
1413	1413	Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!	1	1

1418	1418	My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1	1
1419	1419	I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.	0	1
142	142	It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.	0	1
1420	1420	The management is rude.	0	1
1421	1421	So far it has worked like a charm.	1	1
1422	1422	This place is amazing!	1	1
1423	1423	There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  	0	1
1424	1424	I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	1	1
1425	1425	This movie is so awesome!  	1	1
1426	1426	Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	1	1
1427	1427	They dropped more than the ball.	0	1
1428	1428	I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1	1
1429	1429	Not even good for camp value!  	0	1
143	143	I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	1	1
1430	1430	Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0	1
1431	1431	Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.	0	1
1432	1432	Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  	1	1
1433	1433	This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  	0	1
1434	1434	NOT WHAT I WANTED.	0	1
1435	1435	The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	1	1
1436	1436	There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	1	1
1437	1437	I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	1	1
1438	1438	Excellent!.	1	1
1439	1439	You can't beat that.	1	1
144	144	Meredith M was better than all right.  	1	1
1440	1440	I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  	0	1
1441	1441	Very good phone.	1	1
1442	1442	Waitress was sweet and funny.	1	1
1443	1443	A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0	1
1444	1444	For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  	1	1
1445	1445	One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  	0	1
1446	1446	i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  	0	1
1447	1447	The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	1	1
1448	1448	Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.	1	1
1449	1449	It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.	0	1
145	145	I'm trying to return it for a refund.	0	1
1450	1450	Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  	0	1
1451	1451	But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.	1	1
1452	1452	Sauce was tasteless.	0	1
1453	1453	Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1	1
1454	1454	We would recommend these to others.	1	1
1455	1455	Very good food, great atmosphere.1	1	1
1456	1456	there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  	0	1
1457	1457	Waste of money.	0	1
1458	1458	Don't buy this product - It fails!.	0	1
1459	1459	Waitress was a little slow in service.	0	1
146	146	I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.	0	1
1460	1460	Doesn't Work.	0	1
1461	1461	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	0	1
1462	1462	This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.	0	1
1463	1463	The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).	0	1
1464	1464	Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.	0	1
1465	1465	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0	1
1466	1466	Their steaks are 100% recommended!	1	1
1467	1467	Not worth it.	0	1
1468	1468	It worked very well.	1	1
1469	1469	Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1	1
147	147	See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  	1	1
1470	1470	I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0	1
1471	1471	Great sound and service.	1	1
1472	1472	The pleather case doesn't fit.	0	1
1473	1473	This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	1	1
1474	1474	This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.	1	1
1475	1475	I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0	1
1476	1476	I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.	1	1
1477	1477	Excellent performance.  	1	1
1478	1478	So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0	1
1479	1479	Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1	1
148	148	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1	1
1480	1480	This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.	0	1
1481	1481	I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.	0	1
1482	1482	So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  	0	1
1483	1483	I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1	1
1484	1484	I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	1	1
1485	1485	We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1	1
1486	1486	This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1	1
1487	1487	best bluetooth on the market.	1	1
1488	1488	I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.	0	1
1489	1489	Improper description.... I had to return it.	0	1
149	149	It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	1	1
1490	1490	Used and dirty.	0	1
1491	1491	He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1	1
1492	1492	I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1	1
1493	1493	I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  	0	1
1494	1494	Food was delicious!	1	1
1495	1495	This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.	1	1
1496	1496	The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0	1
1497	1497	That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1	1
1498	1498	His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  	0	1
1499	1499	If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1	1
15	15	The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  	0	1
150	150	And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0	1
1500	1500	definitely will come back here again.	1	1
1501	1501	However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.	0	1
1502	1502	It doesn't make you look cool.	0	1
1503	1503	This is a good joint.	1	1
1504	1504	I love this thing!	1	1
1505	1505	Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.	0	1
1506	1506	Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	1	1
1507	1507	:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	1	1
1508	1508	The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0	1
1509	1509	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0	1
151	151	This case seems well made.	1	1
1510	1510	Its the best headset I have used.	1	1
1511	1511	"The writers were ""smack on"" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  "	1	1
1512	1512	Last time buying from you.	0	1
1513	1513	This film has no redeeming features.  	0	1
1514	1514	Reasonably priced also!	1	1
1515	1515	Worth every penny.	1	1
1516	1516	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1	1
1517	1517	The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	0	1
1518	1518	Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  	0	1
1519	1519	Would not go back.	0	1
152	152	This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.	0	1
1520	1520	Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	1	1
1521	1521	you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.	1	1
1522	1522	Thank you for wasting my money.	0	1
1523	1523	The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	1	1
1524	1524	And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  	0	1
1525	1525	You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  	1	1
1526	1526	Very good lunch spot.	1	1
1527	1527	This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1	1
1528	1528	It didn't charge for me.	0	1
1529	1529	Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.	1	1
153	153	This place deserves no stars.	0	1
1530	1530	What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.	0	1
1531	1531	Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	0	1
1532	1532	Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.	1	1
1533	1533	Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0	1
1534	1534	These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  	0	1
1535	1535	Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	1	1
1536	1536	I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.	0	1
1537	1537	I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  	0	1
1538	1538	Phone falls out easily.	0	1
1539	1539	Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1	1
154	154	Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0	1
1540	1540	I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0	1
1541	1541	I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.	0	1
1542	1542	The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.	1	1
1543	1543	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.	0	1
1544	1544	So just beware.	0	1
1545	1545	For the price this was a great deal.	1	1
1546	1546	I rate this movie 9/10.  	1	1
1547	1547	The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0	1
1548	1548	Very wind-resistant.	1	1
1549	1549	Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	1	1
155	155	For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0	1
1550	1550	Good value, great food, great service.	1	1
1551	1551	Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0	1
1552	1552	Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  	1	1
1553	1553	Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1	1
1554	1554	The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  	0	1
1555	1555	Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.	0	1
1556	1556	If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.	0	1
1557	1557	(It works!)	1	1
1558	1558	Pretty piece of junk.	0	1
1559	1559	The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.	1	1
156	156	Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  	0	1
1560	1560	lightweight and works well.	1	1
1561	1561	I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	1	1
1562	1562	Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	0	1
1563	1563	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	1	1
1564	1564	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	1	1
1565	1565	Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0	1
1566	1566	Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  	0	1
1567	1567	CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	1	1
1568	1568	He was terrible!	0	1
1569	1569	The food was terrible.	0	1
157	157	Left very frustrated.	0	1
1570	1570	The real disappointment was our waiter.	0	1
1571	1571	Warning - Stay away.	0	1
1572	1572	Poor product.	0	1
1573	1573	I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.	1	1
1574	1574	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0	1
1575	1575	An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.	1	1
1576	1576	I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0	1
1577	1577	The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	1	1
1578	1578	This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0	1
1579	1579	I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.	1	1
158	158	The food came out at a good pace.	1	1
1580	1580	We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1	1
1581	1581	I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.	0	1
1582	1582	I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  	1	1
1583	1583	Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0	1
1584	1584	If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0	1
1585	1585	The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1	1
1586	1586	This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.	0	1
1587	1587	First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.	0	1
1588	1588	Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	1	1
1589	1589	The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	1	1
159	159	No real improvement.	0	1
1590	1590	And I really did find them funny.  	1	1
1591	1591	We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	1	1
1592	1592	VERY funny!  	1	1
1593	1593	Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	1	1
1594	1594	Never got it!!!!!	0	1
1595	1595	It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.	0	1
1596	1596	Defective crap.	0	1
1597	1597	Overall, a delight!  	1	1
1598	1598	Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.	1	1
1599	1599	& That movie was bad.  	0	1
16	16	Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1	1
160	160	The worst one of the series.  	0	1
1600	1600	I never walked out of a movie faster.  	0	1
1601	1601	Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  	0	1
1602	1602	The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	1	1
1603	1603	If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	1	1
1604	1604	[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!	0	1
1605	1605	Sprint - terrible customer service.	0	1
1606	1606	It is worth the drive.	1	1
1607	1607	If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.	0	1
1608	1608	The story is beyond stupid.  	0	1
1609	1609	The story line is just awful!  	0	1
161	161	Very good, though!	1	1
1610	1610	for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0	1
1611	1611	The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  	1	1
1612	1612	I hate movies like that.  	0	1
1613	1613	Nothing at all to recommend.  	0	1
1614	1614	OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	1	1
1615	1615	The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	1	1
1616	1616	We are sending it back.	0	1
1617	1617	I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.	0	1
1618	1618	I LOVED it!	1	1
1619	1619	in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.	0	1
162	162	For that, it's worth checking out.  	1	1
1620	1620	So bad...well...it's just bad.  	0	1
1621	1621	I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0	1
1622	1622	The battery life is highly unacceptable.	0	1
1623	1623	Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1	1
1624	1624	This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1	1
1625	1625	(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0	1
1626	1626	great headset, very impressed - H500.	1	1
1627	1627	The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  	0	1
1628	1628	I bought two of them and neither will charge.	0	1
1629	1629	The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0	1
163	163	The problem was the script.  	0	1
1630	1630	Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.	1	1
1631	1631	My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.	0	1
1632	1632	Everything was perfect the night we were in.	1	1
1633	1633	Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.	1	1
1634	1634	The visual effects were AWFUL.  	0	1
1635	1635	Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1	1
1636	1636	When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1	1
1637	1637	The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1	1
1638	1638	Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  	1	1
1639	1639	On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	1	1
164	164	Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0	1
1640	1640	The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	1	1
1641	1641	1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  	0	1
1642	1642	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1	1
1643	1643	I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;	1	1
1644	1644	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	1	1
1645	1645	This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1	1
1646	1646	Very little music or anything to speak of.  	0	1
1647	1647	Excellent Phone.	1	1
1648	1648	Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).	0	1
1649	1649	Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	1	1
165	165	This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1	1
1650	1650	There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.	0	1

1734	1734	" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
It deserves strong love.  	1
It is an insane game.  	1
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
Waste your money on this game.  	1
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	1
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
Today the graphics are crap.  	0
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
This game rocks.  	1
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
But it's just not funny.  	0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
Long, whiny and pointless.  	0
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1
Totally believable.  	1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
There are some generally great things in it.  	1
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	0
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1

1757	1757	The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	0	1

1877	1877	This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  	0	1

1903	1903	That company is a joke.	0	1
1904	1904	I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1	1

1914	1914	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1	1
1915	1915	Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  	1	1
1916	1916	Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0	1
1917	1917	That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).	0	1
1918	1918	We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0	1
1919	1919	A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.	1	1

203	203	It was also the right balance of war and love.  	1	1
204	204	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0	1
205	205	They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  	1	1
206	206	Works great!.	1	1
207	207	the cast was great.  	1	1
208	208	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.	0	1

21	21	first time there and might just be the last.	0	1
210	210	The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0	1
211	211	Setup went very smoothly.	1	1
212	212	I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0	1
213	213	Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.	0	1
214	214	It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	0	1
215	215	Its not user friendly.	0	1
216	216	Fantastic food!	1	1
217	217	Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	1	1
218	218	Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  	0	1
219	219	She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  	1	1
22	22	Awkward to use and unreliable.	0	1
220	220	Unfortunately it did not work.	0	1
221	221	Great case and price!	1	1
222	222	Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  	1	1
223	223	Krussel Always good.	1	1
224	224	Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0	1
225	225	How can that be?The audio quality is poor.	0	1
226	226	Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  	1	1
227	227	On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1	1
228	228	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	0	1
229	229	first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0	1
23	23	a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0	1
230	230	Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.	0	1
231	231	Highly recommended A+  	1	1
232	232	I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  	1	1
233	233	The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1	1
234	234	Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.	0	1
235	235	But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  	0	1
236	236	If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0	1
237	237	This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0	1
238	238	Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.	0	1
239	239	say bye bye to your tip lady!	0	1
24	24	Both great!	1	1
240	240	This place should honestly be blown up.	0	1
241	241	Happy so far!.	1	1
242	242	One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	0	1
243	243	It looks very nice.	1	1
244	244	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1	1
245	245	The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0	1
246	246	I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1	1
247	247	Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0	1
248	248	Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1	1
249	249	Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0	1
25	25	I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	1	1
250	250	The accompanied software is almost brilliant.	1	1
251	251	This is a great little item.	1	1
252	252	We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0	1
253	253	I rather enjoyed it.  	1	1
254	254	And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0	1
255	255	Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  	0	1
256	256	Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	0	1
257	257	Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0	1
258	258	It was pretty gross!	0	1
259	259	Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	1	1
26	26	We are so glad we found this place.	1	1
260	260	WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.	0	1
261	261	It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  	1	1
262	262	Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.	1	1
263	263	The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	0	1
264	264	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0	1
265	265	The staff are also very friendly and efficient.	1	1
266	266	Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.	1	1
267	267	Gets the job done.	1	1
268	268	I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0	1
269	269	Everything about it is just bad.  	0	1
27	27	I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.	1	1
270	270	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0	1
271	271	REALLY UGLY.	0	1
272	272	This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.	0	1
273	273	I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	0	1
274	274	The cast is always entertaining as usual.  	1	1
275	275	This was like the final blow!	0	1
276	276	No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0	1
277	277	We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0	1
278	278	The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1	1
279	279	The manager was the worst.	0	1
28	28	Great phone.	1	1
280	280	Freezes frequently4.	0	1
281	281	Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  	1	1
282	282	Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0	1
283	283	What this film lacks is a convincing script.  	0	1
284	284	I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0	1
285	285	I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	1	1
286	286	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1	1
287	287	The instruction manual is lacking.	0	1
288	288	Great for iPODs too.	1	1
289	289	We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1	1
29	29	It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.	1	1
290	290	The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	1	1
291	291	We won't be returning.	0	1
292	292	However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	1	1
293	293	Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0	1
294	294	THAT one didn't work either.	0	1
295	295	My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0	1
296	296	I'm super pissd.	0	1
297	297	It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	1	1
298	298	Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.	1	1
299	299	putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  	0	1
3	3	A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0	1
30	30	Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1	1
300	300	I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  	1	1
301	301	It was a great phone.	1	1
302	302	This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	0	1
303	303	This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	1	1
304	304	This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	0	1
305	305	Soyo technology sucks.	0	1
306	306	awesome device.	1	1
307	307	No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	1	1
308	308	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.	0	1
309	309	As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1	1
31	31	Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0	1
310	310	The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.	0	1
311	311	Go watch it!  	1	1
312	312	Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.	1	1
313	313	But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0	1
314	314	Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0	1
315	315	Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!	0	1
316	316	Great product, fast shipping!.	1	1
317	317	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	1	1
318	318	Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory	0	1
319	319	I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0	1
32	32	My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1	1
320	320	Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	1	1
321	321	What a big waste of time.	0	1
322	322	I'm very disappointed with my decision.	0	1
323	323	Which are small and not worth the price.	0	1
324	324	Just don't know why they were so slow.	0	1
325	325	"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."	0	1
326	326	We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0	1
327	327	THey are so cool!	1	1
328	328	My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0	1
329	329	I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	1	1
33	33	Good product, good seller.	1	1
330	330	They have a really nice atmosphere.	1	1
331	331	Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.	0	1
332	332	I received it quickly and it works great!!	1	1
333	333	They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1	1
334	334	don't waste your money and time.	0	1
335	335	Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0	1
336	336	Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1	1
337	337	I will not return.	0	1
338	338	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.	0	1
339	339	Incredible!.	1	1
34	34	"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."	0	1
340	340	I love this bluetooth!	1	1
341	341	Waiter was a jerk.	0	1
342	342	The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0	1
343	343	The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  	1	1
344	344	The result is a film that just don't look right.  	0	1
345	345	This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  	1	1
346	346	If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0	1
347	347	It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	1	1
348	348	He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0	1
349	349	Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0	1
35	35	The waitress and manager are so friendly.	1	1
350	350	I would recommend this.	1	1
351	351	All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	1	1
352	352	What I really like there is the crepe station.	1	1
353	353	In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1	1
354	354	AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.	0	1

425	425	My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0	1

495	495	Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1	1
496	496	" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
Do not waste your time.  	0
It was just too horrible.  	0
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
The poor actors.  	0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
The dialogue sucked.  	0
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	0
The soundtrack sucked.  	0
The acting sucked.  	0
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
That was nice.  	1
That was funny.  	1
It was so funny.  	1
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
I came out of it feeling angry.  	0
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	0
There is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
Again, lame.  	0
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	0
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  	0
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0
The acting was bad.  	0
Really bad.  	0
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
Camerawork - again, bad.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap"".  "	0	1
497	497	Easy to use.	1	1
498	498	DELICIOUS!!	1	1
499	499	Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  	1	1

522	522	"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all."	0	1
523	523	From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1	1
524	524	You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  	1	1
525	525	The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	1	1
526	526	It is simple to use and I like it.	1	1
527	527	But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1	1
528	528	The kids play area is NASTY!	0	1
529	529	They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0	1
53	53	I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  	1	1

531	531	So Far So Good!.	1	1

534	534	Conclusion - I loved it.  	1	1
535	535	Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0	1
536	536	The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	1	1
537	537	It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  	0	1
538	538	The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  	0	1

548	548	Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	1	1
549	549	I especially love the long battery life.	1	1
55	55	This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0	1

551	551	It's AGGRAVATING!	0	1

557	557	I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0	1
558	558	I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	1	1
559	559	Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0	1
56	56	Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.	0	1
560	560	One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1	1
561	561	Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1	1

565	565	Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  	0	1
566	566	AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0	1
567	567	The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  	0	1
568	568	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	0	1
569	569	what a disappointment	0	1
57	57	An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1	1
570	570	All in all, a great disappointment.  	0	1
571	571	Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	1	1

58	58	Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.	1	1
580	580	To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1	1
581	581	Great service and food.	1	1
582	582	Damn good steak.	1	1
583	583	Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1	1
584	584	However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0	1
585	585	The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  	0	1
586	586	I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  	0	1

592	592	The service was extremely slow.	0	1
593	593	We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1	1
594	594	The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	1	1
595	595	The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  	0	1
596	596	John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  	1	1
597	597	There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  	0	1
598	598	The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0	1
599	599	The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  	1	1

60	60	Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  	1	1
600	600	The reception through this headset is excellent.	1	1
601	601	This one works and was priced right.	1	1
602	602	The fries were great too.	1	1
603	603	The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1	1
604	604	We loved the place.	1	1
605	605	I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  	1	1
606	606	It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  	0	1
607	607	This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	1	1
608	608	My sister has one also and she loves it.	1	1
609	609	Great pork sandwich.	1	1
61	61	1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.	0	1
610	610	This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	0	1
611	611	Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  	1	1
612	612	Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1	1
613	613	The service was poor and thats being nice.	0	1
614	614	The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0	1

618	618	Great audio!.	1	1
619	619	The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1	1
62	62	Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1	1
620	620	Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  	1	1
621	621	If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  	0	1
622	622	This is an excellent film.  	1	1
623	623	It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	1	1
624	624	I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  	0	1
625	625	Excellent sound quality.	1	1
626	626	The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0	1
627	627	And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1	1
628	628	And service was super friendly.	1	1
629	629	but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  	0	1
63	63	but it is great, i would really recommend it	1	1
630	630	"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  "	1	1
631	631	Really awful.  	0	1
632	632	At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	0	1
633	633	The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  	0	1
634	634	As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  	1	1
635	635	"You'll love it!  	1
This movie is BAD.  	0
So bad.  	0
The film is way too long.  	0
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  	1
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  	1
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	0
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	1
His performance is simply genius.  	1
He owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  "	1	1
636	636	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!	1	1
637	637	Wow very spicy but delicious.	1	1
638	638	however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.	0	1
639	639	This is not movie-making.  	0	1
64	64	But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  	1	1
640	640	About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  	0	1
641	641	The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.	1	1
642	642	Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  	0	1
643	643	I love all the features and form factor.	1	1
644	644	i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.	1	1
645	645	This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  	1	1
646	646	The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1	1
647	647	very slow at seating even with reservation.	0	1
648	648	Even worse than Ticker!  	0	1
649	649	I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!	1	1
65	65	Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0	1
650	650	The selection of food was not the best.	0	1
651	651	We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0	1
652	652	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	1	1
653	653	I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  	0	1
654	654	Wow... Loved this place.	1	1
655	655	The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.	0	1
656	656	Absolutel junk.	0	1
657	657	"The film gives meaning to the phrase, ""Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  "	1	1
658	658	It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.	1	1
659	659	Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	0	1
66	66	Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0	1
660	660	Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  	0	1
661	661	I paid too much.  	0	1
662	662	It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.	0	1
663	663	The BT headset was such a disapoinment.	0	1
664	664	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.	0	1
665	665	A great film by a great director.  	1	1
666	666	The service was not up to par, either.	0	1
667	667	Item Does Not Match Picture.	0	1
668	668	It was probably dirt.	0	1
669	669	The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.	1	1
67	67	The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  	0	1
670	670	It is zillion times away from reality.  	0	1
671	671	Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	1	1
672	672	I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.	1	1
673	673	I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.	0	1
674	674	After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	0	1
675	675	Bad Quality.	0	1
676	676	I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0	1
677	677	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.	0	1
678	678	I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1	1
679	679	"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""	1	1
68	68	Sending it back.	0	1
680	680	Very easy to use.	1	1
681	681	Very much disappointed with this company.	0	1
682	682	Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0	1
683	683	All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1	1
684	684	Awful service.	0	1
685	685	The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	1	1
686	686	The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0	1
687	687	It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.	1	1
688	688	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1	1
689	689	I've never been treated so bad.	0	1
69	69	The ambiance was incredible.	1	1
690	690	Really pleased with this product so far.	1	1
691	691	I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.	0	1
692	692	Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	1	1
693	693	"I also didn't like the ""on"" button, it felt like it would crack with use."	0	1
694	694	It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	1	1
695	695	"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."""	1	1
696	696	It was quite comfortable in the ear.	1	1
697	697	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0	1
698	698	The iGo chargers and tips are really great.	1	1
699	699	I don't think you will be disappointed.  	1	1
7	7	We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0	1
70	70	Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	1	1
700	700	Adapter does not provide enough charging current.	0	1
701	701	Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  	1	1
702	702	But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1	1
703	703	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0	1
704	704	An excellent performance from Ms.  	1	1
705	705	Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  	1	1
706	706	(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)	1	1
707	707	Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.	0	1
708	708	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0	1
709	709	It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	1	1
71	71	Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	1	1
710	710	It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  	0	1
711	711	Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.	1	1
712	712	New Battery works great in phone.	1	1
713	713	One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.	0	1
714	714	Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0	1
715	715	After one bite, I was hooked.	1	1
716	716	Thoroughly disappointed!	0	1
717	717	I never come again.	0	1
718	718	There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  	0	1
719	719	Great phone!.	1	1
72	72	When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0	1
720	720	Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1	1
721	721	My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!	0	1
722	722	Good case, Excellent value.	1	1
723	723	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0	1

725	725	I really liked that.  	1	1
726	726	"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "	0	1
727	727	Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.	0	1
728	728	I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	1	1
729	729	Don't miss it.  	1	1
73	73	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.	1	1
730	730	AMAZON SUCKS.	0	1
731	731	I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.	1	1
732	732	Best fish I've ever had in my life!	1	1
733	733	Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.	0	1
734	734	Piece of Junk.	0	1
735	735	Omelets are to die for!	1	1
736	736	"People who like European films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.  "	1	1
737	737	I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  	0	1
738	738	I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.	1	1
739	739	"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  "	1	1
74	74	A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  	1	1
740	740	As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.	0	1
741	741	Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	1	1
742	742	It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0	1
743	743	Basically the service was very bad.	0	1
744	744	The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  	1	1
745	745	The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.	0	1
746	746	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1	1
747	747	Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  	0	1
748	748	Brilliance indeed.  	1	1
749	749	This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1	1
75	75	MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  	1	1
750	750	- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1	1
751	751	The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1	1
752	752	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.	1	1
753	753	This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	1	1
754	754	I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1	1
755	755	Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	1	1
756	756	You won't forget this movie!  	1	1
757	757	Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0	1
758	758	Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  	0	1
759	759	The film looks cheap and bland.  	0	1
76	76	The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.	0	1
760	760	This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1	1
761	761	This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	1	1
762	762	This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.	0	1
763	763	I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0	1
764	764	Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  	1	1
765	765	The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	1	1
766	766	The directing is sloppy at best.  	0	1
767	767	Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	0	1
768	768	Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1	1
769	769	It was horrible!.	0	1
77	77	It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.	0	1
770	770	I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  	0	1
771	771	If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	1	1
772	772	Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	1	1
773	773	Do not make the same mistake as me.	0	1
774	774	Good , works fine.	1	1
775	775	After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.	1	1
776	776	Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0	1
777	777	Excellent dual-purpose headset.	1	1
778	778	I keep watching it over and over.  	1	1
779	779	The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  	1	1
78	78	Very prompt service.	1	1
780	780	- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0	1
781	781	I found this product to be waaay too big.	0	1
782	782	It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  	0	1
783	783	First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0	1
784	784	camera color balance is AWFUL.	0	1
785	785	Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	1	1
786	786	Don't bother - go to the store.	0	1
787	787	Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	0	1
788	788	If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0	1
789	789	They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1	1
79	79	Iam very pleased with my purchase.	1	1
790	790	The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0	1
791	791	Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	1	1
792	792	Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!	1	1
793	793	The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0	1
794	794	That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	1	1
795	795	Not recommended.  	0	1
796	796	We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1	1
797	797	After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0	1
798	798	Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  	1	1
799	799	Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0	1
8	8	The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1	1
80	80	Simply beautiful.  	1	1
800	800	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0	1
801	801	Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	1	1
802	802	Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1	1
803	803	The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.	1	1
804	804	Excellent starter wireless headset.	0	1
805	805	Jawbone Era is awesome too!	1	1
806	806	I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0	1
807	807	A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  	1	1
808	808	The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1	1
809	809	Does not fit.	0	1
81	81	You can find better movies at youtube.  	0	1
810	810	The shipping time was also very quick!	1	1
811	811	if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	0	1
812	812	The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1	1
813	813	Definitely a bargain.	1	1
814	814	Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	1	1
815	815	I've had better atmosphere.	0	1
816	816	Overall, I like this place a lot.	1	1
817	817	Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.	0	1
818	818	This is actually a very smart movie.  	1	1
819	819	About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0	1
82	82	I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0	1
820	820	Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1	1
821	821	Really good product.	1	1
822	822	This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  	0	1
823	823	"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	0	1
824	824	Great brunch spot.	1	1
825	825	The sound quality is excellent as well.	1	1
826	826	I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	1	1
827	827	VERY DISAPPOINTED.	0	1
828	828	The camera really likes her in this movie.  	1	1
829	829	None of them are engaging or exciting.  	0	1
83	83	The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0	1
830	830	I wouldn't recommend buying this product.	0	1
831	831	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	0	1
832	832	This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0	1
833	833	Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.	1	1
834	834	too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0	1
835	835	Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1	1
836	836	This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	1	1
837	837	So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1	1
838	838	They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	1	1
839	839	Truly awful.	0	1
84	84	im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.	1	1
840	840	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0	1
841	841	It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  	1	1
842	842	Awesome selection of beer.	1	1
843	843	In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.	0	1
844	844	I would not recommend this item to anyone.	0	1
845	845	Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  	1	1
846	846	Works great.	1	1
847	847	The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.	1	1
848	848	There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0	1
849	849	The commercials are the most misleading.	0	1
85	85	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	0	1
850	850	I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	1	1
851	851	Too politically correct.  	0	1
852	852	I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	1	1
853	853	Audio Quality is poor, very poor.	0	1
854	854	You wont regret it!  	1	1
855	855	What a mistake.	0	1
856	856	this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1	1
857	857	Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	1	1
858	858	I will be back many times soon.	1	1
859	859	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0	1
86	86	Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1	1
860	860	Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	1	1
861	861	It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	1	1
862	862	If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0	1
863	863	"Looks great and is strong."""	1	1
864	864	Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1	1
865	865	The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0	1
866	866	Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0	1
867	867	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.	1	1
868	868	I couldn't take them seriously.  	0	1
869	869	Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0	1
87	87	It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  	0	1
870	870	You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.	0	1
871	871	However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.	0	1
872	872	You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!	0	1
873	873	The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1	1
874	874	It was equally awful.	0	1
875	875	This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	1	1
876	876	The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1	1
877	877	Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	0	1
878	878	Nice design and quality.	1	1
879	879	2 Thumbs Up!!	1	1
88	88	Good case!.	1	1
880	880	What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  	0	1
881	881	Poor quality.	0	1
882	882	So absolutley fantastic.	1	1
883	883	"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design."	0	1
884	884	Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!	1	1
885	885	The least said about the acting the better.  	0	1
886	886	Never had anything to complain about here.	1	1
887	887	Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1	1
888	888	The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  	0	1
889	889	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.	0	1
89	89	What did bother me, was the slow service.	0	1
890	890	It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  	1	1
891	891	They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	1	1
892	892	Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	1	1
893	893	Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	0	1
894	894	If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  	0	1
895	895	This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  	0	1
896	896	The best phone in market :).	1	1
897	897	Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.	0	1
898	898	By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0	1
899	899	Poorly contstruct hinge.	0	1
9	9	But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	1	1
90	90	I wasted my little money with this earpiece.	0	1
900	900	It just blew.  	0	1
901	901	The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	0	1
902	902	I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0	1
903	903	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	1	1
904	904	The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  	0	1
905	905	The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1	1
906	906	I'm pleased.	1	1
907	907	Worst customer service.	0	1
908	908	Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	1	1
909	909	Nice case, feels good in your hands.	1	1
91	91	I only hear garbage for audio.	0	1
910	910	I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0	1
911	911	The service here is fair at best.	0	1
912	912	I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0	1
913	913	We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0	1
914	914	We were promptly greeted and seated.	1	1
915	915	Love this product.	1	1
916	916	The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	0	1
917	917	DELETE this film from your mind!  	0	1
918	918	Give it a try, you will be happy you did.	1	1
919	919	Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0	1
92	92	10 out of 10 stars.  	1	1
920	920	He's a national treasure.  	1	1
921	921	This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	0	1
922	922	You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  	0	1
923	923	Service was good and the company was better!	1	1
924	924	I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0	1
925	925	The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.	1	1
926	926	The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1	1
927	927	Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  	1	1
928	928	The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  	0	1
929	929	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	1	1
93	93	Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0	1
930	930	I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  	1	1
931	931	"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""	0	1
932	932	After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.	0	1
933	933	This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.	1	1
934	934	Why was this film made?  	0	1
935	935	Everyone is treated equally special.	1	1
936	936	I love this phone!.	1	1
937	937	It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.	1	1
938	938	The phone is sturdy and waterproof.	1	1
939	939	I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  	0	1
94	94	Great product for the price!.	1	1
940	940	All the bread is made in-house!	1	1
941	941	Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  	0	1
942	942	Couldn't figure it out	0	1
943	943	We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0	1
944	944	I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.	1	1
945	945	There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0	1
946	946	Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!	0	1
947	947	It's pretty easy.	1	1
948	948	It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1	1
949	949	The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	1	1
95	95	What a waste of money and time!.	0	1
950	950	This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1	1
951	951	Would recommend this item.	1	1
952	952	I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	0	1
953	953	The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	1	1
954	954	I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	1	1
955	955	I can't wait to go back.	1	1
956	956	We'd definitely go back here again.	1	1
957	957	If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	1	1
958	958	These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.	1	1
959	959	Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.	1	1
96	96	This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1	1
960	960	Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	0	1
961	961	Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.	1	1
962	962	They do not care about the consumer one bit.	0	1
963	963	I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.	0	1
964	964	By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0	1
965	965	I hope this place sticks around.	1	1
966	966	Would not reccommend.	0	1
967	967	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1	1
968	968	It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.	1	1
969	969	I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  	0	1
97	97	Cant get the software to work with my computer.	0	1
970	970	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0	1
971	971	Works fine.	1	1
972	972	A bit predictable.  	0	1
973	973	I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  	0	1
974	974	It is a joy to use.	1	1
975	975	I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1	1
976	976	It was not good.	0	1
977	977	This phone works great.	1	1
978	978	After two I felt disgusting.	0	1
979	979	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	1	1
98	98	stay away from this store, be careful.	0	1
980	980	Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1	1
981	981	No buyers remorse on this one!.	0	1
982	982	Cant say enough good things about this place.	1	1
983	983	#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.	1	1
984	984	I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	1	1
985	985	Don't buy this product.	0	1
986	986	Battery life is real good.	1	1
987	987	I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	1	1
988	988	However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	0	1
989	989	During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.	0	1
99	99	"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".  "	1	1
990	990	Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0	1
991	991	Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  	1	1
992	992	Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  	0	1
993	993	Excellent product for the price.	1	1
994	994	I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.	0	1
995	995	Weird vibe from owners.	0	1
996	996	Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0	1
997	997	I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0	1
998	998	It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.	1	1
999	999	We won't be going back anytime soon!	0	1
